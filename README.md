# Hey-Doraemon-Game-
Hey Doraemon! (Game) Harvard University

-Developed a game called "Hey Doraemon!" using Scratch, a visual programming language, as part of a project at Harvard University.

-Implemented the game logic and mechanics, creating an interactive experience where players control the character 'the flying Doraemon' to chase dorayaki while avoiding collision with the red line.

Designed engaging visuals and animations to enhance the game's aesthetics and user experience, capturing the essence of the popular character Doraemon.

-Implemented scoring mechanisms to track and display the player's performance, rewarding points for successfully collecting dorayaki and penalizing for collisions. Conducted iterative testing and debugging to ensure smooth gameplay, address any bugs or glitches, and optimize performance
